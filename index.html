        <p>
          Ogo Kerubu-Serafu Project is generally conceptualised for the major
          purpose of projecting, promoting and rebranding the peculiarities of
          the C &amp; S Church, some of which are misunderstood by other comity
          of Churches and the general public, whereas those peculiarities are
          actually the basis of the Church and the manifestation of such is our
          Glory. Hence, the ‘OGO KERUBU-SERAFU’ PROJECT.
        </p>
        <p>
          As members of Cherubim and Seraphim Church on earth, we have the
          mandate to fulfil on earth the mandate of the heavenly Cherubs and
          Seraphs. The earthly Cherubim and Seraphim are duty bound to exhibit
          in different manifestations the peculiar natures and assignment of the
          heavenly Cherubim and Seraphim as their counterparts on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this implication, C &amp; S members are the glory of God on earth
          in the order of the heavenly Cherubs and Seraphs, and are expected to
          do all in capacities to exhibit and radiate this glory in all manners,
          and through diverse mediums and platforms. Hence, the
          conceptualization of ‘Ogo Kerubu-Serafu’ Project to contribute to the
          efforts to fulfil and replicate on earth the mandate of the heavenly
          Cherubim and Seraphim through continuous and series of activities
          expressed through diverse mediums and platforms such as TV/Radio
          shows, strategic campaigns, documentaries, revivals, philanthropic
          projects, Corporate Social Responsibility projects and especially,
          special events and programs.
